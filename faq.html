    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <section id="questions">
      <div class="section-holder">
        <div class="section">
          <h2>What is RocketPad?</h2>
        	<p>RocketPad is a custom, rigorous accelerator for high school students where members will learn the principles of entrepreneurship and business by launching a real company alongside experienced mentors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>How is RocketPad formatted?</h2>
        	<p>While the majority of the accelerator will be spent working on their company, students can expect lectures, exercises, and innovative curricula. We’ll also have frequent field trips to startups and innovation spaces in the LA area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Who will teach the lectures?</h2>
        	<p>Along with both of the founders of RocketPad, certain guest speakers and lecturers from the LA, SF, and Boston startup communities will make appearances! More details will be revealed soon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Do I need to have a busienss idea prior to applying?</h2>
        	<p>You do not need to have a business idea or plan! Everybody has passions, and we’ll work with you during the first week to transform yours into a scalable venture (or help you find another team that you’re equally passionate about!).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Will there be any homework or graded assignments?</h2>
        	<p>The startup life is addicting - we can’t guarantee you won’t want to check your daily sales revenue from home. However, while you’ll get regular feedback from coaches, mentors, and staff members throughout the six weeks about both your business and personal development, no grades will be assigned.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Can students outside of Los Angeles apply to the program?</h2>
        	<p>We’d love to have you apply, but we can’t provide housing or be responsible for your daily transportation. If you’re under 18, you’d have to live with an adult somewhere in Los Angeles and manage your own commute.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>How can I receive a scholarship?</h2>
        	<p>Any acceptance to RocketPad is need blind, meaning any financial aid application is considered independently of admission. If you deserve to be here, we’ll make it possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>What grades and ages may apply?</h2>
        	<p>Any incoming high schooler may apply to RocketPad - that is to say, if you’ll be a 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th grader in the fall of 2017, apply away!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>What are the selection criteria?</h2>
        	<p>The first thing we look for is passion about a venture, industry, or activity. Apart from a true desire to jump headfirst into entrepreneurship, prior business experience, technical skills, and stellar grades also help!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>What application materials are needed?</h2>
        	<p>Apart from a brief application, you’ll need a letter of recommendation from a mentor or teacher, a resume or LinkedIn page, and an unofficial transcript from your school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>How will I find out if I was accepted?</h2>
          <p>We'll reach out by email to let you know about any updates to your application. Super easy!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Does the application cost anything?</h2>
        	<p>It is 100% free to apply to RocketPad. If accepted, a $500 deposit is required to confirm your spot (subject to change based on your financial aid package).</p>
